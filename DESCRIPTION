Description: Performs Wavelet Lifting Transforms focusing on signal denoising 
    and functional data analysis (FDA). Implements a hybrid architecture with 
    a zero-allocation 'C++' core for high-performance processing. Features include 
    unified offline (batch) denoising, causal (real-time) filtering using a 
    ring buffer engine, and adaptive recursive thresholding.
